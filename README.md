# Healthcare-Trauma-Center-DataScience-Project


This repository contains an exploratory data science project aimed at understanding and predicting mistriages in trauma care systems. Inspired by the paper “Locating Trauma Centers Considering Patient Safety”（Hirpara, Vaishnav, Parikh, Kong, Parikh 2022）, the project investigates how various operational and systemic factors—such as transport delays, hospital selection protocols, and injury severity—contribute to under-triage and over-triage. By combining insights from the existing mathematical optimization model with real or simulated data, this project aspires to develop a predictive algorithm for identifying patients at high risk of mistriage. Future steps will include formalizing the research objectives, conducting a literature review on mistriage metrics, and exploring machine learning methods for classification and outcome prediction.
